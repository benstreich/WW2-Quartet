<h1 align="center">WW2-Quartet</h1> <br>
This project was created in collaboration with rayback00001 (github-name). It was created on Visual Studio with C++.
This was the first time use of struct and pointer. Honestly wasn't a big fan at first, but once I understood it was kinda fun ;)
The theme of the quartet has no particular reason, we just thought it would be a good idea to choose something typical for a quartet. <br>

<h2 align="center">Language</h2> <br>
The Game was made in German but you should just understand it just fine if you are no native speaker. If requested I could get around doing a english version. <br>

<h2 align="center">Controlls</h2> <br>
not required to press enter! <br>
(1) is starting <br>
(2) is rules <br>
(3) Exit <br>

<h2 align="center">Game</h2> <br>
You against the Computer ðŸ‘¾
Select value: <br>
-(1) km/h <br>
-(2) summit height <br>
-(3) horse power <br>

depending on that, you either win the computers card or you lose yours
